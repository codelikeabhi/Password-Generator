# Password-Generator
Password Generator is a user-friendly web application designed to create secure and customizable passwords.

Key Features:

Password Length Slider: Users can select the desired length of their password using a user-friendly slider. The slider range typically varies from 8 to 32 characters, allowing users to strike a balance between security and convenience.

Character Set Selection: The app offers various character sets for password generation, such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Users can customize their password's complexity by toggling these sets on or off.

Random Password Generation: Upon clicking the "Generate" button, the app utilizes JavaScript to create a random password based on the user's preferences. The password is then displayed on the screen for the user to copy and use as needed.

Copy to Clipboard: A convenient "Copy" button enables users to quickly copy the generated password to their clipboard, eliminating the need for manual selection.

Aesthetically Pleasing: The app's design incorporates CSS styling to enhance visual appeal, with a coherent color scheme and layout that promotes easy readability and interaction.

Security Note:
Password Generator creates random and secure passwords, it does not store or retain any generated passwords on the server or locally. Each time a user generates a password, it is entirely independent of any previous passwords generated.
